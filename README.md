# Twitter Bootstrap v2.3.0.0 for Rails 3/4
Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.

Note: if you are looking for bootstrapped date and time pickers please take a look at [anjlab-widgets](https://github.com/anjlab/anjlab-widgets) gem.


anjlab-bootstrap-rails project integrates Bootstrap CSS (with Sass flavour) and JS toolkits for Rails 3 projects

## Rails > 3.1
Include Bootstrap in Gemfile;

``` ruby
gem 'anjlab-bootstrap-rails', '>= 2.3', :require => 'bootstrap-rails'
```

or you can install from latest build;

``` ruby
gem 'anjlab-bootstrap-rails', :require => 'bootstrap-rails',
                              :git => 'git://github.com/anjlab/bootstrap-rails.git'
```

and run bundle install.

## Stylesheets

Add necessary stylesheet file to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

``` css
*= require twitter/bootstrap
```

You can override bootstrap variables:

 1. replace `*= require twitter/bootstrap` with `*= require app_bootstrap`
 2. create `app_bootstrap.css.scss` :

```scss
// change colors
$linkColor: red;

// change grid
$gridColumnWidth: 70px;
$gridGutterWidth: 10px;

// import original bootstrap
@import "twitter/bootstrap";
@import "twitter/bootstrap-responsive";
```
 NOTE: restart `pow` if you are using it.

## Javascripts

Add necessary javascript(s) files to app/assets/javascripts/application.js

``` javascript
// Include all twitter's javascripts
//= require twitter/bootstrap

// Or peek any of them yourself
//= require twitter/bootstrap/transition
//= require twitter/bootstrap/alert
//= require twitter/bootstrap/modal
//= require twitter/bootstrap/dropdown
