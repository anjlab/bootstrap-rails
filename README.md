# Bootstrap v3.0.3 for Rails 3/4
Bootstrap is a toolkit originated at Twitter that's designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.

Note: if you are looking for bootstrapped date and time pickers please take a look at [anjlab-widgets](https://github.com/anjlab/anjlab-widgets) gem.

anjlab-bootstrap-rails project integrates Bootstrap CSS (with Sass flavour) and JS toolkits for Rails 3/4 projects


## Rails > 3.1

In your Gemfile
``` ruby
gem 'anjlab-bootstrap-rails', :require => 'bootstrap-rails',
                              :github => 'anjlab/bootstrap-rails'
```

You can install from latest build via git

``` ruby

gem 'anjlab-bootstrap-rails', '~> 3.0.3.0', :require => 'bootstrap-rails'
```

and run bundle install.

## Stylesheets

1. Rename application.css to application.css.scss
2. Import bootstrap `@import "twitter/bootstrap";`
3. You can override vars above `@import "twitter/bootstrap";`

```scss

// change colors
$link-color: red;

// import original bootstrap
@import "twitter/bootstrap";

```
 NOTE: restart `pow` if you are using it.

## Javascripts

Add necessary javascript(s) files to app/assets/javascripts/application.js

``` javascript
// Include all bootstrap javascripts
//= require twitter/bootstrap

// Or peek any of them yourself
//= require twitter/bootstrap/transition
